Use the executables to grade our Platform, Trampoline, and Treadmill and ReverseTreadMill classes. Aiden (abs4cr) will 
submit code to test the SwingingArm and Fan classes.

Floryan recommended we don't make a "curved platform/ramp" object as the physics would be too tricky to handle
in the amount of time we have.

Thanks!
