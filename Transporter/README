COMPILING AND RUNNING FROM THE COMMAND LINE
-------------------------------------------------------------

This code comes with a bash script that compiles and runs the project. To compile and run, simply:

- Make sure makefile.sh is executable (if not, run 'chmod 777 makefile.sh' or similar if you don't want to give those permissions)
- Open makefile.sh in a text editor and make sure the last line references the correct path to main class
	- Change this path if necessary
- Simply run ./makefile.sh at the command line
	- script will compile and run your project





CREATING AN EXECUTABLE JAR FILE FROM COMMAND LINE
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you are done, you can create an executable jar file to make it easier for us to run and test your code.

To do this, simply:

- Open manifest.txt
- Make sure the line containing "Rsrc-Main-Class: ..." contains the correct path to your main java class
- run the following command at the command line:
	jar cvfm lab1.jar manifest.txt bin/ src/ resources/ org/
- you should see lab1.jar appear
- To test, try running the following and see if your game starts: java -jar lab1.jar

*ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE DONE FROM THE MAIN DIRECTORY OF YOUR PROJECT. So, java/ and this directory should contain resources/, src/, bin/, org/ etc.
